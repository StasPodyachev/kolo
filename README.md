## What is Kolo?

Kolo Protocol - censorship resistant trading platform for sensitive information with transparent notary mechanics. Organize auctions, tenders, p2p-sales for exclusive content or services. Crowdfund DeScience projects or online meetings with celebrities. Trade files, storage, computing or access.

## Description

Filecoin's main value proposition is providing a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to traditional cloud storage providers. Thatâ€™s why we've built a tool that creates new use cases for enlarging the network and illuminating the uniqueness of Filecoin.
Kolo is a cutting-edge project being developed for the FVM Space Warp Hackathon. It aims to create a fair and censorship-resistant platform for trading sensitive information, leveraging the power of the Filecoin network and governed by the DAO.
